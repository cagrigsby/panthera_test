# About Me

My name is Chris, and I've created this page to help chart my progress in the field of penetration testing. As such, I've included a page to store my Lab Writeups for popular pentesting labs from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), Offensive Security's [Proving Grounds](https://www.offsec.com/labs/0), and [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com), as well as any others I may come acrosss. I've also decided to store my notes for the [OSCP+](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/).

Like many others I found myself seeking a new career when I lost my job during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. An aptitude test pointed me toward IT, and after taking an online course, I found myself really interested in cybersecurity. As you may know, it's not a simple field to break into, but I really enjoyed it and had plenty of free time on my hands. Fortunately there a ton of resources, and I dug into damn near all of them. I learned about Linux, took coding courses, and I spent a ton of time on  Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Udemy, and YouTube. I am tremendously grateful for all of my online teachers. 

After passing a few certifications, eventually I found work as a security consultant! Success! But kept pushing, and  I completed level certification called the [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) or ethical Junior Penetration Tester, to gauge where I was at. And since then I've really enjoyed studying penetration testing, doing [writeups](https://pentestpop.github.io/writeups/) for popular labs, and writing some [scripts](https://github.com/pentestpop/) to help me automate my process. In early November 2024, I passed [Offsec's new OSCP+](https://www.offsec.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-oscp-plus/), and I'm so excited to keep learning more!
