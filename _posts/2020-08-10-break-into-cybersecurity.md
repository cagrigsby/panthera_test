Occasionally I get asked what I did to get into cybersecurity. After all, it's often said within the field that, "There are no entry-level jobs in crybersecurity," and from a brief glance at my resume, I could be considered to be an exception, depending on how you feel about the inclusion of security compliance. In a lot of ways, perhaps I am, though looking back on my life, I can see evidence of someone creating my own experience from an early age. Regardless, I think it makes sense to write something that explains how I got started that includes not just the concrete steps I took deliberately, but also the context of what I knew early on. If you just want to know what I did once I decided to get into IT and eventually cybersecurity, you can safely skip to [COVID-19 and Beyond](https://cagrigsby.github.io/2024/08/10/break-into-cybersecurity.html#COVID-19-and-beyond). 

## Adolescent Tinkering
I'd like to start before college. After all, professional employment candidates do not exist in a vaccuum...and neither do I. I think at this point it's not unexpected for security types to have gotten their start in engineering or hacking of some kind before even going to college. You certainly hear of teenage hackers, and there are high schools (not mine) with coding courses. I've even seen a high school digital forensics class, though I assume it must be some kind of special elective. I didn't have any of that, but I *did* have an interest in using computers in ways outside their expected use. Not so long ago, it was actually difficult and expensive to find everything you wanted. 

I discovered what I know now are called Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Directory Traversal simply by browsing the web for galleries and open directories. And it was always a jackpot to find someone's unsecured FTP server full of movies. Before youtube, it wasn't uncommon for websites to host their own media files which you could download by getting into the source code and finding the asset referenced. I remember using [this page](http://www.therapboard.com/) to download rapper's catchphrases to use as text tones for my friends. I'm honestly surprised it's still up. Looking for music is how I learned about Google Dorking, though there were certainly sketchier techniques we don't need to get into. I had to have few to sell bootleg leaks. And I think my first experience with the command line involved jailbreaking phones. 

To be honest, those are some of the tamer examples, but hey my name is on here. I'm not giving them because I think they're so interesting. Rather, I'm just trying to paint a picture of someone who was primed to learned about cybersecurity. Most people I knew back then didn't do any of that stuff, so when I talk about starting from zero, I just want to be clear that **my zero may not be the same as your zero**. I had a computer from a young age, and I have to acknowledge it was a specific time in history when everything was online, you still needed to find it. There was value in discovering how the web worked, and I sought it out more than my peers.
