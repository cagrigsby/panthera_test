# About Me

My name is Chris, and I've created this page to help chart my progress in the field of penetration testing. As such, I've included a page to store my Lab Writeups for popular pentesting labs from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), Offensive Security's [Proving Grounds](https://www.offsec.com/labs/0), and [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com), as well as any others I may come acrosss. I've also decided to store my notes for the [OSCP+](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/). 

Like many others I found myself looking for a new career when I lost my job during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I was recommended an aptitude test from [YouScience](https://www.youscience.com/student-aptitudes/) as a jumping off point. My results pointed my towards IT, and I got to work on the IT Professional Certificate from [Google](https://grow.google/certificates/it-support/). I found myself really enjoying the section on cybersecurity and began focusing on what I felt was the most fun part of IT. After I completed the Google cert, I started researching what else I might need to break into a cybersecurity career. As you may know, it's not a simple field to break into, but I really enjoyed it and had plenty of free time on my hands. I took some courses in Linux, Python, SQL, and eventually passed my CompTIA's [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) certification, thinking surely I could find a foothold at that point. It turned out to be a little more complicated than that. I continued to work on my skills through online platforms like [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), the latter of which I spent a ton of time on. I think my highest rank was around 6,000 out of 1,000,000+ users. My public profile can be found [here](https://tryhackme.com/p/grica421). 

Eventually I found work as a security consultant! Success! But I'd fallen in love with pentesting, probably because it appealed to my love of using technical skills in ways that were...alternative...to the expected behavior. I completed level certification called the [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) or ethical Junior Penetration Tester to gauge where I was at. I figured I could take the OSCP after that, but life got in the way for a while. I continued to spend a lot of time out of work honing more general skills and achieving CompTIA's [CySA+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst) as well as a few AWS certifications to get more familiar with cloud infrastructure. Now I'm refocusing my energy on pentesting and hope to pass the OSCP in August of 2024!
